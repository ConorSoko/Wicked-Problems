Nieves et al. use the random forest machine learning method to predict logarithmically-transformed human population distributions across the globe. A random forest model is essentially a network of decision trees that bu themselves would be unable to accurately predict the dependent variable. Instead, by layering a network of them and adding various weights to each covariate, the forest model is able to accurately model predictive data. By testing the model's results against the known data, the forest will reassign variable weights until the model accurately fits the test data, thereby theoretically making the overall model more accurate and effective. The results are then dasymmetrically allocated, meaning that the given geographic area is broken down into smaller areas of reletive homogeneity and filled in with the data from the predictive random forest model. One result of Nieves et al.'s research using this method is that built environment, ecology, and topography are the most important geospatial covariates in predicting global population distributions.
