The authors describe two methods of disaggregating population data into high-resolution, gridded cells. The first, the "top down" method, utilize total census counts as an input. The data are then combined with various ancillary data sets, including road networks and geographic features, to come up with the best estimate of population distribution within a given census boundary. The second technique, called the "bottom up" method, is actually the same as the top down method with one important distinction. Instead of the input being total census data, the bottom up method utilizes strategic sample counts of the population in various areas as an input. The reason for this discrepancy is that there exists an incredible challenge to performing or acquiring accurate current census counts. War, migration, ethnic conflict, and general costs are a huge impediment to census work around the globe. By instead sampling the population, it is possible to save considerable resources and still gain an accurate population estimate of a geographic area. That said, the top down method, if provided with correct total census data, is most likely to be the more accurate of the two methodologies.

Both methods provide considerable advantages to past approaches, namely considering population distribution as a continuous function instead of as discrete values. This function can then be regressed with various covariate geographic filters to provide more accurate predictions than the discrete-value based models. An example of each would include
