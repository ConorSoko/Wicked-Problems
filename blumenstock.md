# Response to Blumenstock

Blumenstock begins by acknowledging the rise of digital data collection in the world of international development aid. An increased number of satellite images, digital footprints, and algorithms to process these big data items are readily accesible. Governments and humanitarian agencies promise to use these new developments to more efficiently and effectively allocate aid to a larger number of people throughout the world.

However, there exist a number of pitfalls that the development community must overcome. First, Blumenstock takes into account that a lot of the resources becoming available to people in need may not necessarily be helping them; for example, a vast minority of poor people gaining access to small pay-day loans aren't even aware of the interest rates being charged. Such financial inexperience could lead to long-term harm. Second, due to the novelty of big data technology, there is little known about its limitations. Blumenstock warns about relying too heavily on these new methods, with the danger that researchers don't yet know the flaws of the data collection system (i.e. people gaming the system). If too much money is invested based on flawed data, then irreperable damage could ensue. Third, data-based aid allocation relies on personalized, digital footprints. In order to have a digital footprint, however, one needs to have access to the internet. This requirement leaves out some of the poorest members of society, thereby posing the risk of leaving them behind, while inadvertently supporting the more wealthy people in the area. Fourth, there is little to no regulation on data collection in developing countries, which could allow companies to violate the privacy rights of individuals and discriminate against individuals based on an abstract "social credit score", as is already being seen in China.

Not all of Blumenstock's thesis is pessimistic, however. He sees hope
